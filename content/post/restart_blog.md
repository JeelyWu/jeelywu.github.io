I have been writing a blog since I graduated from college. 

And the old posts were deployed in different platforms.  

I didn't write too much in the past years, and didn't have too many visitors  

Many times, I often forget that I have a blog :) Obviously, I am not a professional blogger 

As a developer from China, I want to improve my English skill. I think it is a proper way to write blog in English. (Maybe somethings in Chinese too :)

So, I have started a new blog on GitHub. And I hope to write more in the future.
